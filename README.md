# Image Captioning with Transformer

This project implements an image captioning system using Transformer architecture. Given an input image, the model generates a natural language description.

## 📌 Features

- Encoder-decoder Transformer architecture for image captioning
- Pretrained CNN encoder for feature extraction (e.g., ResNet)
- Positional encoding and masked attention in decoder
- Tokenized caption generation using teacher forcing during training
- BLEU score evaluation for caption quality

## 🧠 Architecture

- **Encoder**: CNN backbone (e.g., ResNet-50) extracts image features.
- **Decoder**: Transformer decoder processes visual features and generates text.
- **Training**: Cross-entropy loss between predicted captions and ground truth.
- **Inference**: Greedy decoding or beam search to generate captions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning-transformer.git
cd image-captioning-transformer
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the dataset

Download and preprocess your own dataset. Make sure the image-caption pairs are organized properly.

### 4. Run the notebook

Launch Jupyter and open `captioning_transformer.ipynb`.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 🧪 Evaluation

* BLEU score is used to evaluate caption quality.
* Sample captions are visualized alongside their corresponding images in the notebook.

## 📈 Results

| Metric | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| BLEU-1 | 0.45  |
| BLEU-4 | 0.56  |

*(Replace with actual scores after training)*

## 🔧 Configuration

Model hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, embedding size, number of heads) can be adjusted in the notebook.
